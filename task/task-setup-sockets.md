I have nearly zero hands-on exprience with sockets so we need to break it down to small chunks and then implement step by step.

Firstly, can you give me a overview of what socket is and how it works for a frontend dev perspective.

This is some questions that i have:

- What is a socket?
- How does it work?
- What socket role in server?
- What socket role in client?
- How can I use sockets in this feature?

More infomation are appriciated.

When i feel comfortable with this stack, i'll starting next step.

1. Install Socket.IO on server
2. Set up basic connection
3. Add message broadcasting
4. Connect client
5. Test it working
